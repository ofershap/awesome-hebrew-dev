## Adding a Resource

1. Fork the repo
2. Add the resource under the appropriate category
3. Follow this format:

```markdown
- [Resource Name](https://url) — Short English description. | תיאור קצר בעברית.
```

4. Keep resources in alphabetical order within each section
5. Open a PR with a clear title

## Guidelines

- Resources must be developer-focused (not general tech news)
- Hebrew or Israeli-focused resources only
- Resource must be actively maintained
- No duplicates — check the list first
- One resource per PR is preferred (easier to review)
